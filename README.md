# Flex-Battery-Interrupter

A battery interrupter is a simple, affordable device that enables you to switch adapt many battery powered electronics devices and toys. The battery interrupt is slipped in between the batteries or battery and battery terminal, breaking the circuit until a switch is attached and closed.

This device is a battery interrupter based on a flexible PCB with a mono/stereo 3.5Â mm audio jack.

The original design was created by Dale Grover which is called [Flex_Battery_Interrupter_200](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Flex-Battery-Interrupter/tree/main/Design_Files/PCB_Files/Flex_Battery_Interrupter_200). 

The shorter model was created to offer an even more affordable option which is called [Flex_Battery_Interrupter_100](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Flex-Battery-Interrupter/tree/main/Design_Files/PCB_Files/Flex_Battery_Interrupter_100).

The difference between the two models is simply the length of the battery interrupter. 

## Flex PCB Models

The design files for the two models are available and can be found using following links:

  1. [Flex_Battery_Interrupter_100](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Flex-Battery-Interrupter/tree/main/Design_Files/PCB_Files/Flex_Battery_Interrupter_100) (100 mm x 34 mm)
  2. [Flex_Battery_Interrupter_200](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Flex-Battery-Interrupter/tree/main/Design_Files/PCB_Files/Flex_Battery_Interrupter_200) (203.3 mm x 34.3 mm)

## 3D Printed case

[Flex_Battery_Interrupter_Jack_Case](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Flex-Battery-Interrupter/tree/main/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files) provides additional support for both Flex PCB and the 3.5mm jack.
